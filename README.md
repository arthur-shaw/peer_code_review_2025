# Peer Code Review 2025

This repository contains baseline analysis code for an ongoing project. The code is designed to clean, construct, and analyze various indicators including household willingness to pay for electricity systems, with additional controls such as household head income, asset index, household size, and distance to the nearest LV.

## Prerequisites

Before running the code, please ensure you have the following installed on your laptop:

- **Dropbox Desktop:** Required to synchronize data from Dropbox.
- **R:** The programming language used to run the analysis.
- **RStudio:** An IDE that makes it easier to work with R code.

## Data Access

The data needed for this project is shared via Dropbox.

After downloading the data, **update the path in the code** to match the location of the data on your computer. This may involve modifying the file path string to point to your local Dropbox folder.

## Running the Code

1. Download the data from Dropbox using the link above.
2. Update the data path in the R scripts to point to your local Dropbox folder in line 14 of the script
4. Open the project "peer_code_review_2025.Rproj" in RStudio.
5. Run the scripts in whole to generate the outputs. The outputs produced should match the ones in the `output_compare` folder provided in the repository.

## Output

The generated outputs (plots, tables, etc.) will be saved to a designated output folder. The original output has been reserved in the `output_reserve` folder for reference.
